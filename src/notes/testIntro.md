look at the request

could mock out but they're kinda gnarly

what happens if api changes?

hosting on lambda is fine but testing workflow not ideal

-------------------------

what if we could just interact with alexa as a user would?

- make a request
- handle it via local dev
- return a response

can't directly but...

-------------------------

works with an intermediate

for that, ngrok
